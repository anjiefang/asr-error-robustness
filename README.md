# ASR Error Robustness Dataset

## Description

This dataset contains data used in [1]. We propose a data generation pipeline to generate an ASR dataset with ASR errors given its original reference dataset. 
The released dataset contains four parts: 1) SST, 2) TQ, 3) SQuAD (~8.8k samples) and 4) SUBJ (~5.8k samples).


## License
Dataset distribution under the [CC BY-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0). 
The released dataset originally comes from four public datasets, i.e. SST [2], TQ [3], SQuAD [4], and SUBJ [5]. 
The released modification version is obtained by injecting ASR errors into the original dataset 
(see [1]). 
We appreciate the authors of the four original public datasets.

## How to Download
The dataset is stored at a public Amazon S3 bucket: `asr-error-robustness`. See more in [Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/asr-error-robustness/). 

You will need to install [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to access the dataset, e.g. to download the dataset, you can use:

```
aws s3 cp s3://asr-error-robustness ~/ --recursive
```

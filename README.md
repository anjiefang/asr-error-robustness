# ASR Error Robustness Dataset

## Description

This dataset contains data used in our paper [1]. We used a data generation pipeline to generate an ASR dataset with ASR errors given its original reference dataset. 
The released dataset contains four parts: 1) SST, 2) TQ, 3) SQuAD (~8.8k samples) and 4) SUBJ (~5.8k samples)

The released dataset originally comes from four public datasets, i.e. SST [2], TQ [3], SQuAD [4], and SUBJ [5]. 
The released modification version is obtained by injecting ASR errors into the original dataset 
(see [1]). 
We appreciate the authors of the four original public datasets.
